# Zen Coder

*A coding ritual for developers who value simplicity, clarity, and quiet control.*

**Zen Coder** isn't just another VS Code extension—it's a state of mind.

It automatically injects your project's coding principles, testing philosophy, and AI collaboration guidelines into your development flow. It ensures that every time you work with GitHub Copilot or any AI assistant, your unique workflow and constraints are gently but firmly enforced.

> *"Good code is like walking through an empty Tokyo street at midnight. Every line where it belongs. No clutter. No noise."*

## ✨ Why Zen Coder?

In the era of AI-assisted coding, many developers risk losing the essence of clean, thoughtful, human-centric development. AI tools can be powerful, but they often forget the big picture: maintainability, simplicity, and purpose.

Zen Coder ensures that every project begins from a place of clarity.

- Your design stays the source of truth.
- Your testing philosophy is never forgotten.
- Your changelog remains a living memory of your project.
- Copilot, Claude, and others follow *your* rules, not the other way around.

It’s the antidote to bloated, tangled, AI-generated codebases.

## 🔥 Features

- Automatically loads your project's coding philosophy on startup.
- Prepares Copilot for your preferred testing approach and coding style.
- Auto-opens your project’s Zen configuration for easy reference.
- Provides `/engage_zen` command to manually re-inject Zen context at any time.
- Keeps your development flow simple, focused, and test-driven—without rigidity.

## 🧘 Typical Workflow (The Zen Coder Way)

1. **Start With a Design or Idea.**
   - Create a rough UI/UX design in Figma or a design tool.
   - Write your project’s purpose and tech stack in `PROJECT.md`.

2. **Describe The Plan.**
   - Use Claude or ChatGPT to brainstorm high-level architecture or feature plans.
   - Document initial decisions or user stories.

3. **Invoke Zen Coder.**
   - On workspace open, Zen Coder auto-loads your Zen context.
   - Alternatively, run `Zen Coder: Engage Zen Mode` to manually inject context.

4. **Unleash Copilot (or Another AI).**
   - Let Copilot generate code—but under strict Zen supervision.
   - Code must follow simplicity, testability, and design-first principles.

5. **Develop Thoughtfully.**
   - Follow the documented Zen Workflow for coding, testing, and refactoring.
   - Ensure the changelog stays updated.

6. **Maintain Your Garden.**
   - Regularly update tests and refactor to keep code lean and focused.
   - Expand Zen Coder rules as your project grows.

## 🪄 Why It Matters

Zen Coder is not just a tool—it’s a quiet revolution against chaotic, thoughtless development.

It’s for developers who want to:
- Write less, but better.
- Let AI assist without losing control.
- Keep projects small, beautiful, and maintainable.

No hype, no clutter. Just clarity.

> *“When you code with Zen, every file, every function, every test feels like it’s exactly where it should be.”*
